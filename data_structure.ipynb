        "- Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, managing, and storing data in a way that enables efficient access and modification.\n",
        "- They help in optimizing the performance of algorithms by enabling efficient data access and modification.\n",
        "- They help in managing memory efficiently by determining how data is stored and accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2:  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        "- Mutable Data Types:\n",
        "- Can be changed after they are created.\n",
        "       - my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "         my_list.append(4)\n",
        "- We can add, remove, or modify elements in the list without creating a new list.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Immutable Data Types:\n",
        "- Cannot be changed after they are created.\n",
        "        - my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "          new_string = my_string + \" world\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3: What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "- Lists are mutable, created with square brackets [ ], and can be changed after creation.\n",
        "- Tuples are immutable, created with parentheses ( ), and cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "- Lists are ideal for data that needs to change, while tuples are great for fixed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4: Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value.\n",
        "\n",
        "5: Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "- Sets are used when you need to store unique elements and don't care about order. They automatically eliminate duplicates and provide faster membership tests compared to lists. They're ideal for situations where uniqueness and quick lookups are important, like managing a collection of unique items or performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "6: What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "- A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, like \"hello\". It's immutable, meaning once created, it cannot be changed. A list, on the other hand, is a collection of items (which can be of different types) enclosed in square brackets [] and is mutable, so you can modify its elements after creation. While strings store text, lists can store a collection of items, and you can change their contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "7: How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "- Tuples ensure data integrity by being immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed. This immutability ensures that the data remains consistent and unchanged throughout the program, preventing accidental modifications. This makes tuples a reliable choice for storing fixed collections of data that must remain constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "8: What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "- A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs using a technique called hashing. In Python, dictionaries use hash tables under the hood to map keys to their corresponding values. This allows for fast data retrieval, insertion, and deletion, as each key is hashed to a unique index in the table, making lookups very efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "9: Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "- Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types. For example, a single list can include integers, strings, and even other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "10:  Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "- Strings are immutable in Python to ensure reliability and consistency. Immutability means once a string is created, it cannot be changed. This allows for optimizations like string interning, where identical strings are stored only once to save memory. Additionally, it ensures that strings can be used safely as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as their hash value remains constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "11: What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "- Dictionaries offer key-value pair storage, which allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions based on unique keys. They are ideal for tasks requiring quick access to data using identifiers. Lists, on the other hand, require scanning through elements, making them less efficient for lookups. Dictionaries provide more flexibility for managing structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "12: Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "- A tuple would be preferable over a list when you need to store a collection of data that should remain constant and not change. For example, using a tuple to store the coordinates of a geographic location (latitude and longitude) is ideal because these values should not be modified. Additionally, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable, while lists cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "13:  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "- Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. When you add elements to a set, any duplicates are removed, ensuring that all elements in the set are unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "14: How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "- The \"in\" keyword checks if a specific element exists in the list.\n",
        "- It iterates through each element in the list and returns True if it finds a match, otherwise False.\n",
        "\n",
        "15: Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "- No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability ensures data integrity and consistency, making tuples a reliable choice for storing fixed collections of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "16: What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "- A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary within a dictionary. It allows you to store and organize data in a hierarchical structure. For example, a nested dictionary can represent information about students, where each student has their own dictionary of attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "17: Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "- In Python, accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1), or constant time, due to the use of a hash table for storing key-value pairs. This allows for fast lookups. In the worst case, due to hash collisions, the time complexity can be O(n), but this is rare with good hash functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "18: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "- Lists are preferred over dictionaries when you need to maintain an ordered collection of elements and perform operations like sorting, slicing, and indexing. Lists are also more suitable for storing sequential data and when the primary need is to access elements by their position rather than by unique keys. If you don't need fast lookups based on unique identifiers, lists are more straightforward and efficient to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "19: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "- Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order of elements based on their insertion. Instead, they use a hash table to map keys to values. This affects data retrieval by allowing for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions based on keys, but it means that the order in which items are stored is not guaranteed. However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries do maintain the insertion order, but this is more of an implementation detail rather than a design guarantee.\n",
